SOAR is a program that provides a seamless solution for managing leaderboards, achievements, players' profiles and automatic rewards distribution on the Solana blockchain. Currently supporting invocation from a TypeScript client and with the [Solana.Unity-SDK](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK). The program IDL is public and other clients can be easily auto-generated. 

## ⚙ Features

- Leaderboard Creation: Easily create leaderboards to track and display user rankings based on specific criteria or metrics.
- Achievement Management: Define and manage achievements that can be unlocked by users based on their on-chain activities.
- TypeScript Client Support: Invoke SOAR functionalities using a TypeScript client, allowing for seamless integration with your Solana application.
- CPI Invocation: Interact with SOAR through CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) calls, enabling secure and efficient communication between programs.
- Solana.Unity-SDK Integration (Coming Soon): Integration with the Solana.Unity-SDK is currently underway, providing an additional layer of functionality for Unity-based applications.
